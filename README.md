## Web Application
Summary of the learning outcome: You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.

For this learningoutcome I will make a full stack web application for beer lovers. For the user-friendly design I did a research about UI/UX. You can find it [here](https://github.com/JManders07/Portfolio-s3/blob/main/IP/Documentation/UI%20Research.pdf). In this document I will describe what UI is, how you can design a good UI and how I made my design.

For a full stack application we need to use a commonly accepted frontend Javascript framework. I have chosen for Vue with Vue-bootstrap for my front-end. For my back-end I am going to use two languages. For the main back-end I am going to use C#. For my Admin back-end I will use Java. In my C# back-end I will use entity framework. In my Java back-end I will use (to research). Before I made these choices I created some prototypes you'll find [here](https://github.com/JManders07/Portfolio-s3/tree/main/IP/Learningoutcomes/Web-application).

For my final project I made seperate git repo's.
