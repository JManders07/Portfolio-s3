## Main goal application
The main goal of my application is that an user can view multiple beers on the website. The beers will be collected from an API. After this an user can leave a commend or rate the beer. If there is enough time there will be also a chat where you can send messages to your friends. The front-end will be written on a javascript based language, probably react or vue. The back-end will be written on c# or java.

## Users
The application is made for everyone above the age of 18. It serves as an information source for everyone who loves special beers.
